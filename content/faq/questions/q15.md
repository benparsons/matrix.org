### What is the difference between Matrix and XMPP?

We think of Matrix and [XMPP]{.definition} as being quite different; at its core
Matrix can be thought of as an eventually consistent global JSON db with
an HTTP API and [pubsub]{.definition} semantics - whilst XMPP can be thought of as a
message passing protocol. You can use them both to build chat systems;
you can use them both to build pubsub systems; each comes with different
tradeoffs. Matrix has a deliberately extensive 'kitchen sink' baseline
of functionality; XMPP has a deliberately minimal baseline set of
functionality. If XMPP does what you need it to do, then we're genuinely
happy for you! Meanwhile, rather than competing, an XMPP Bridge like
[Skaverat's xmpptrix beta](https://github.com/SkaveRat/xmpptrix) or
[jfred's matrix-xmpp-bridge](https://github.com/jfrederickson/matrix-xmpp-bridge)
or Matrix.org's own [purple-matrix](https://github.com/matrix-org/purple-matrix/)
has potential to let both environments coexist and make the most of each
other's benefits.

The whole area of XMPP vs Matrix is quite subjective.
Rather than fighting over which open interoperable communication
standard works the best, we should just collaborate and bridge everything
together.  The more federation and interoperability the better.
