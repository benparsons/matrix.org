### Where do my conversations get stored?

Each [homeserver]{.definition} stores the communication history and account information for all of its [client]{.definition}s, and shares data with the wider Matrix ecosystem by synchronising communication history with other homeservers and their clients. Clients typically communicate with each other by emitting events in the context of a virtual room. Room data is [replicated][federation]{.definition} across all of the homeservers *whose users are participating in a given room*.
