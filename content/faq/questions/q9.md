### Why have you released this as open source?

We believe that any open standard defining interoperable communication needs to be justified, demonstrated and validated with transparent open source implementations. For Matrix to achieve its mission of making all communications services [interoperable]{.definition} we believe it needs to be truly open, giving people access to take all the code we produce and to use and build on top of it.
