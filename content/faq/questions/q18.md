### How does Matrix compare with something like Trillian or Pidgin?

Trillian and Pidgin and similar aggregating IM clients merge all your IM
activity into a single app.  However, your history and
identity is still fragmented across the networks.  People can't find you
easily, and your history is fragmented (other than on the device
where the client runs).   And rather than being able to chose the right
app for the job when communicating with people, you are pushed towards
relying on a specific aggregation app.

Matrix lets you get the best of both worlds by linking to all the
different networks (XMPP, AIM, ICQ, Lync, Skype etc) on the serverside,
using bridges which can be run by anyone.  Matrix then provides a simple
standard HTTP API to access any of these networks, and lets you choose
whichever client you prefer (either as a 'native' Matrix client or using
a non-Matrix client from one of the networks which has been bridged in).
