### What do you mean by open?

Matrix is an open standard, meaning that we have freely published the
details for how to communicate [interoperably][interoperable]{.definition} using the Matrix set of
HTTP APIs.  We encourage anyone and everyone to use the APIs and build
their own projects which implement them and so benefit from
interoperability with the rest of the Matrix ecosystem.  We also
ensure the standard is not encumbered by any known patent licensing
requirements.

Matrix is also open source, meaning that we have released the source
code of the reference servers, clients and services to the public domain
under the [Apache Licence v2](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html), to
encourage anyone and everyone to run their own servers and clients, and
enhance them and contribute their enhancements as they see fit.
