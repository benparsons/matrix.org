### How do I join the global Matrix federation?

You can [choose a client](#matrix-compliant-apps) and create a user account on an existing homeserver.

To host your own [homeserver]{.definition} you can download and run one of the available Matrix servers - please see [this guide](https://matrix.org/docs/guides/getting_involved.html#run) for details!

To better understand how to enable [federation]{.definition} in [Synapse]{.definition}, take a look at [the specific docs](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse#setting-up-federation).
