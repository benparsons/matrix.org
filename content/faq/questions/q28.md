### How can I get involved?

There are plenty of ways to get involved. First, [create a user account](#how-do-i-get-an-account-and-get-started%3F) and come say hi on [#matrix:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#matrix:matrix.org)!

Then...

* Install [synapse]{.definition} and tell us how you get on.
* Critique [the spec]{.definition}, take at look at the [current status](/docs/spec) and see [what has been proposed](/docs/spec/proposals).
* Write [clients][client]{.definition}.
* Write [bridges][bridging]{.definition}! Run bridges!
* Nose around in the repositories in our
  [GitHub organization](https://github.com/matrix-org) and send us some pull requests
  to fix some bugs or add some features!
* You could even try to write a homeserver
  (but be warned, Matrix's architecture makes homeservers orders of magnitude harder
  than clients or bridges.)

See [CONTRIBUTING.rst](http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tree/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst) for
full details on how to contribute to the project.  All are welcome!
