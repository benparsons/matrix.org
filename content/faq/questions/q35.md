### What is a MXID?

Matrix user IDs (MXID) are unique user IDs. They are in the format ```@username:homeserver.tld``` (this format is used to avoid confusing them with email addresses.) They are intended to be fairly hidden (although right now they are not) - instead you will find and identify other users via [3PID]{.definition}s.
