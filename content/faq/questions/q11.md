### What does federated mean?

Federation allows separate deployments of a communication service to
communicate with each other - for instance a mail server run by Google
federates with a mail server run by Microsoft when you send email from
@gmail.com to @hotmail.com.

[Federation]{.definition} is different to interoperability, as [interoperable]{.definition} clients
may simply be running on the same deployment - whereas in federation the
deployments themselves are exchanging data in a compatible manner.

Matrix provides open federation - meaning that anyone on the internet
can join into the Matrix ecosystem by deploying their own server.
