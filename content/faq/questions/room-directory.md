### How can I get a rooms list from matrix.org?

If you're using [Riot]{.definition}, you can use the "Room directory" screen, which you open from a button in the bottom left.

It you're working on a client, you can use the [Client-Server API](https://matrix.org/docs/guides/client-server.html) to [get a list of public rooms](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.3.0.html#listing-rooms).
