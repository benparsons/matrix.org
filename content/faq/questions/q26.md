### How do I Matrix-enable my existing app?

If your app doesn't have any communication capability already, you'll want
to use one of the Matrix [client SDK]{.definition}s to add it in.   These come in different levels of sophistication - ranging from a simple HTTP API wrapper through to reusable UI components. 

* [matrix-android-sdk](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk)
* [matrix-react-sdk](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk)
* [matrix-python-sdk](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk)
* [matrix-ios-sdk](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk)

There are even [more client SDKs available](https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now.html#client-sdks).

Pick the one for your platform, or a 3rd party one if none of the above work for you,
and get plugging it in.  You'll probably also want to read the [Client-Server API
HOWTO](https://matrix.org/docs/howtos/client-server.html) too.

If you already have communication infrastructure set up (XMPP, custom HTTP, or whatever),
then you'll want to run a bridge to expose it to the wider Matrix ecosystem.
See [matrix-appservice-bridge HOWTO](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/blob/master/HOWTO.md) for a
guide of how to write bridges using the matrix-appservice-bridge framework, or co-opt one
from the list at [https://matrix.org/blog/try-matrix-now](https://matrix.org/blog/try-matrix-now).
[Application Service API](/docs/spec/#application-service-api) gives the details of the API
that bridges have to implement.
