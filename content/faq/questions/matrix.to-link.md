### How do I create a link to a Matrix room or user?

You can link to a Matrix room or user by going to [matrix.to](https://matrix.to), and typing in the room alias or ID for linking to rooms, or a user's Matrix ID for linking to users.  In the future, there will be a URL scheme for Matrix rooms and users, similar to email's `mailto` scheme, or XMPP's `xmpp` scheme.
