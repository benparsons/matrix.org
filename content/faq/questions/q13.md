### Why has no one done this before?

There have been several attempts before including [SIP]{.definition}, [XMPP]{.definition} and [RCS]{.definition}.

All of these have had some level of success, but many different
technological/usability/economic factors have ended up limiting their
success.  Unfortunately, we've not ended up in a world where everyone
has a SIP URI or Jabber ID on their business card, or a phone that
actually uses RCS.

Take a look at the [Comparisons](#comparisons) section for a more detailed look at how Matrix compares to other projects.
