### Where can I find a mobile app?

[Riot]{.definition} is available for Android and iOS.

The iOS version can be downloaded from the [Apple store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vector.im/id1083446067).

The Android version can be downloaded from the [Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=im.vector.app) or [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=im.vector.alpha). If you are not sure which one to choose, install Riot from the [Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=im.vector.app).

For the Android app, you can also install the latest development version
built by [Jenkins](https://matrix.org/jenkins/job/VectorAndroidDevelop). Use it at your own risk and only if you know what you are doing.
