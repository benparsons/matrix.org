### What is the difference between Matrix and Tox?

TODO excluded

Tox.chat looks to be a very cool clone of Skype - a fully decentralised
peer-to-peer network.  Matrix is deliberately not a 'pure' peer-to-peer
system; instead each user has a well-defined homeserver which stores
his data and that he can depend upon.  Matrix provides HTTP APIs;
Tox.chat provides C APIs.  As of October 2015 Tox doesn't seem to have an
answer yet for decentralised conversation history storage.
