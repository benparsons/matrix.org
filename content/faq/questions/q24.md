### What can I actually do with this?

A typical [client]{.definition} provides a simple chatroom interface to Matrix -
letting the user interact with users and rooms anywhere within the
Matrix [federation]{.definition}.  Text and image messages are supported, and basic
voice-only VoIP calling via WebRTC is supported in one-to-one rooms.
(As of October 2015, experimental multi-way calling is also available
on Riot.im).
