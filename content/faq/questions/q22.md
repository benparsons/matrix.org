### Why aren't you doing this through the IETF? or W3C? or 3GPP?

We do recognise the advantages of working with existing standards
bodies. We have been focused on writing code and getting it out, and the standard has been evolving rapidly since initial release in September 2014.
Once the standard has matured sufficiently it may well be appropriate to work with an official
standard body to maintain it going forwards.
