### Where can I get support?

The point of entry for everything matrix is the [room]{.definition} [#matrix:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#matrix:matrix.org) aka \#matrix on irc.freenode.

If you're a developer and are looking to get involved with building something on Matrix, try [#matrix-dev:matrix.org].

If you host a [Synapse]{.definition} homeserver instance and would like support, try [#synapse-community:matrix.org].
