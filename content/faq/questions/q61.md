See also: [What clients are available?](#what-clients-are-available%3F)

#### Riot

You can use [Riot.im](https://riot.im/app/) - a glossy web client written on top of [matrix-react-sdk](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk).

You can also host Riot on your own server. It's a static web application, just download the [last release](https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/) and unpack it.

#### neo

[neo] is a Matrix React.js webclient which aims to be lighter than Riot while still feature complete.
