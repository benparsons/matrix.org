### What is Matrix?

Matrix is an open standard for interoperable, decentralised, real-time communication over IP. It can be used to power Instant Messaging, VoIP/WebRTC signalling, Internet of Things communication - or anywhere you need a standard HTTP API for publishing and subscribing to data whilst tracking the conversation history.

Matrix defines the standard, and provides open source reference implementations of Matrix-compatible Servers, [Client]{.definition}s, [Client SDKs][client sdk]{.definition} and Application Services to help you create new communication solutions or extend the capabilities and reach of existing ones.
