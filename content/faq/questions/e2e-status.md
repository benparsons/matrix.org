### What is the status of E2E?

End-to-End Encryption is currently in late beta. Rooms can have encryption enabled, but it is not by default.

Regarding client support, see [Which matrix clients support E2E?](#which-matrix-clients-support-e2e%3F)

As of July 2018, work is progressing to add E2E support in the [matrix-python-sdk].
