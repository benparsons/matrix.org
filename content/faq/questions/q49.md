Synapse is a reference "[homeserver]{.definition}" implementation of Matrix from the core development team at matrix.org, written in Python 2/Twisted.  It is intended to showcase the concept of Matrix and let folks see the spec in the context of a codebase and let you run your own homeserver and generally help bootstrap the ecosystem.
