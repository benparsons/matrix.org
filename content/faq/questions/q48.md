### Why HTTP? Doesn't HTTP suck? Why don't you use websockets/CoAP/HTTP2/etc?

HTTP may not be the most efficient transport, but it is ubiquitous, very well understood and has numerous implementations on almost every platform and language. It also has a simple upgrade path to HTTP/2, which is relatively bandwidth and round-trip efficient.

For these reasons it has been chosen as the mandatory baseline of the exchange, but it is still entirely possible to use other protocols for communication between clients and server (see for example this [websocket transport spec proposal](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1148)), and it's also possible in the future that negotiation of more efficient protocols will be added for the [federation]{.definition} between servers, with HTTP+JSON remaining as the compatibility baseline.
