### How is this like e-mail?

The [History of email](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_email) is instructive when thinking about the importance of [interoperability][interoperable]{.definition}.

Early email systems behaved as isolated communities which only allowed
you to exchange mail with users on the same system.  If you got your
email from one service and your friend from another, then you couldn't
message each other.  This is basically the situation we're in today with
VoIP and IM.
