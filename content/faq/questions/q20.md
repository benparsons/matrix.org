### What bridges to other networks are available?

There are a large number of '[bridges][bridging]{.definition}' which integrate existing communication networks into
Matrix. This list is growing rapidly, and you can find bridges both written by the Matrix core team
and contributed by the wider community.  The full list can be seen at
