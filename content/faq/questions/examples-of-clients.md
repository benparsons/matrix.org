There are many clients available, ranging from the glossy mass-market to the geeky command-line.  There's even an emacs macro.

Alternatively you can find a client suitable for you:

* if you're using GNOME, try [Fractal]
* [Nheko] is a glossy native desktop app for Matrix, based on Qt5.
* [Quaternion] is a cross-platform desktop client based on Qt5/QML
* if you prefer a command line client, there is a [Matrix plugin for Weechat]
* [neo] is a Matrix React.js webclient
* [Seaglass] is a recently announced (as of July 2018) client written as a native macOS app
