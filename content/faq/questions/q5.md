### What kind of company is Matrix.org?

Matrix.org is an open initiative which acts as a neutral and independent custodian of the Matrix standard. As of Sept 2017 we are finally in the process of incorporating it as a dedicated non-profit entity (most likely a limited by guarantee UK private company called the Matrix.org Foundation).
