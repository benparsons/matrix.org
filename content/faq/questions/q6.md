development, please [get in touch](mailto:matthew@matrix.org).

For the first three years of Matrix's development (2014-2017), most of the core
contributors worked for [Amdocs](https://www.amdocs.com), who paid for them to
work fulltime on Matrix.  In July 2017, Amdocs considered the project to be
sufficiently successful that it could now self-support and so stopped funding.
The majority of the core team is now employed by [New Vector]{.definition}, an independent company
set up to hire the team and support Matrix's development.  Other contributors
are funded by their own employers or donate their own time to the project.

In January 2018, [Matrix.org announced that Status.im made a major strategic investment](https://matrix.org/blog/2018/01/29/status-partners-up-with-new-vector-fueling-decentralised-comms-and-the-matrix-ecosystem/)
in [New Vector]{.definition}, meaning we now have the financial
backing to let us focus entirely on improving the Matrix ecosystem.
