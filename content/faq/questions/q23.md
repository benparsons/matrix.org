### How do I get an account and get started?

The quickest way is to pick a client from [https://matrix.org/blog/try-matrix-now](https://matrix.org/blog/try-matrix-now) and sign up.

Clients can access any [homeserver]{.definition} - you don't have to use matrix.org, though as of July 2018 matrix.org is the largest public homeserver.

hello-matrix.net maintains a [list of public Matrix servers](https://www.hello-matrix.net/public_servers.php).
