### What is the process for adding Spec proposals?

See the documentation at <https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals>. In summary:

* Produce a publicly-accessible proposal describing your change
* Make a new issue at <https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues>, and include the metadata as described
* Gather feedback as widely as possible from the community and core team on the proposal
* Show an implementation to prove that it works well in practice, iterate where needed.
* Make a new spec PR which includes the changes as implemented against <https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/tree/master/specification>.
