### What is an identity server?

Users in Matrix are identified internally via their [matrix user ID (MXID)][MXID]{.definition}. However, existing 3rd party ID ([3PID]{.definition}) namespaces such as email addresses or phone numbers should be used publicly to identify Matrix users, at least for invitation purposes.  A Matrix "Identity" describes both the user ID and any other existing IDs from third party namespaces linked to their account.

Matrix users can link third-party IDs (3PIDs) to their user ID. Linking 3PIDs creates a mapping from a 3PID to a user ID. This mapping can then be used by Matrix users in order to discover the MXIDs of their contacts.

In order to ensure that the mapping from 3PID to user ID is genuine, the intention is for a globally federated cluster of trusted "Identity Servers" (IS) be used to verify the 3PID and persist and replicate the mappings.
Usage of an IS is not required in order for a client application to be part of the Matrix ecosystem. However, without one clients will not be able to look up user IDs using 3PIDs.

The precise architecture of identity servers is currently in flux and subject to change as we work to fully decentralise them.
