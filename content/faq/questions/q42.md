### Do I need a TURN server?

VoIP calls should work if both parties are on public networks. However, in practice one (or both) devices are often behind NAT, and so having a [TURN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traversal_Using_Relays_around_NAT) server is important to help set up the call.

See [this guide](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/turn-howto.rst) for setting up a TURN server with Synapse.
