### How mature is this?

We started working on Matrix in July 2014, and opened it to the
public in September 2014.  We got all the core features in place in December 2014
and entered beta, and since then have been iterating away on the beta refining the
architecture and APIs, fixing bugs and scalability, and adding new features, clients,
bridges etc.

As of October 2015 (synapse 0.10) it's good for serious experimentation and
non-production services and can absolutely be used in the real world.  However, we're
still in beta and we'll want to freeze the spec and implement clustering and other
nice features before we really declare it ready for production.
