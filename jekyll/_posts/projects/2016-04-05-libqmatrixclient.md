libqmatrixclient is a Qt-based library to make IM clients for Matrix. [Quaternion](https://matrix.org/docs/projects/client/quaternion.html) is a reference client using its features; together with the library they form the [QMatrixClient](https://github.com/QMatrixClient) project. The SDK is also used by [Spectral](https://matrix.org/docs/projects/client/spectral.html) and [uMatriks](https://github.com/uMatriks/uMatriks).

The project lives in QMatrixClient [GitHub space](https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient). Aside from the dedicated Matrix room (see above), news about the library are regularly posted to [This Week in Matrix](https://matrix.org/blog/category/this-week-in-matrix/).
