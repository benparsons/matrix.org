# {{ page.title }}
Through exposing a small web server, the webhooks bridge is able to interpret Slack webhooks and post them to designated rooms in Matrix. Additional fields are present for a more matrix-feeling message, if desired. Future plans include outgoing webhooks to notify external services of particular events in rooms.

The source, and more information, can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-appservice-webhooks). Try it out on [t2bot.io](https://t2bot.io/webhooks).
