# {{ page.title }}
This is a bridge to post Instagram media into matrix rooms, with authorization. This bridge does not handle chat and cannot post to Instagram on your behalf, but it is useful for organizations looking to have their Instagram accounts also post to matrix.

The source, and more information, can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-appservice-instagram).
