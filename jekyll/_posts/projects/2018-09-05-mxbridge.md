# {{ page.title }}
A non-puppeting (i.e. bot) bridge between Matrix and XMPP group chats.

This application works by connecting as a user to a Matrix and an XMPP server. When it has been invited and the mapping between two rooms is set up, it joins those rooms and begins forwarding messages to the room connected on the other network.
